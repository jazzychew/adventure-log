                    January - March 2022: became backup FRC Manipulator Lead
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>During Robotics' Rapid React FRC Season, I was chosen to be a backup Manipulator Lead for the robot's intake & indexing systems.</p>
                <p>I was grateful to have the chance to work closely with the Lead and coaches since I learned plentiful lessons on teamwork, cooperation, & project development.</p>
                <p>Along with aiding the design processes for both manipulators, I CADed & assembled the main indexing system.</p>

                    June - August 2022: interned at Three Rivers Park
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>At Three Rivers Park, I got to see myself in the field of engineering.</p>
                <p>I was able to work with civil engineers and architects through job shadowing, being on the field in parks, assisting current projects, & overall spending time with the team!</p>
                <p>One of the projects I aided was updating their trail crossing data. Every decade, data on trail crossing safety is reevaluated to determine what needs to be improved/implemented. It was this task that let me explore many of Three Rivers' parks & meet many parkgoers like myself.</p>
                <p>I also updated the park's DBE database. DBE stands for Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, & the database shows contractors the park system can hire. Despite looking like a plain spreadsheet, I learned important skills in Microsoft Excel and how contracting works which are both important in the engineering world.</p>
                <p>For my final project, the internship has interns create a Cornerstone Project. For mine, I created a short animated presentation displaying the skills & experiences I got throughout my summer. I knew I liked creating slideshows & drawing, so I figured I put two and two together. Just from this project, I learned about animation and how to use Microsoft PowerPoint.</p>
                <p>In addition to all just my job, through the program, I met people in other internship locations, many of which I had fun getting to know since we all came from different backgrounds. In these gatherings, we did various activities like visting Gale Woods Farms and hiking.</p>

                    August 14th, 2022: participated in YWCA Race Forward Women's Triathlon
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>When I found this triathlon, I knew I had to race in it.</p>
                <p>After the worst of the pandemic & physical therapy, I was itching to start training for a triathlon again.</p>
                <p>I became a triathlete when I was eleven & became connected to the sport beacause at the core, a triathlete only competes against themself.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I'm passionate about the positive message the YWCA stands for & wanted to support the cause.</p>
                <p>At the triathlon, I had a blast racing with fellow girls & women of different ages & experiences!</p>

                    June - October 2021: volunteered at the Maple Grove Farmers Market
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Coming back from the previous summer, I was a volunteer at the Farmers Market once again! I fell in love with the sense of comfiness the market provided especially since I first joined after an online school year.</p>
                <p>That summer however, I decided to also work in the PoP (Power of Produce) program which is basically the Frequent Shoppers program for kids. At first, I was a little scared, but with the support of volunteers and my newly gained experience of working with kids because of robotics, I quickly got into the rhythm of it. (however chaotic it was!)</p>
                <p>I liked the market so much that for my 2024 NHS service project proposal, I decided to work with the Farmers Market. Overall, it's a great atmosphere that I definitely will frequent in the summer again.</p>

                    September - December 2022: worked as an FTC Mentor
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>During Power Play FTC Season, I volunteered as a FTC Mechanical Mentor where I got to assist smaller teams in the strategy, design, & construction of their robots.</p>
                <p>I had the wonderful opportunity to connect with many new team members & welcome them into our Robotics team!</p>
                <p>Through FTC, our rookies get to learn important lessons like, "Never give up!" &, "The robot is never done!"</p>
                <p>In all seriousness, I continue to strive to be a reliable upperclassman & friend to the rookies because when I started Robotics, it's those people who motivated me to stay.</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Another passion & hobby of mine, I decided to indulge myself in writing.</p>
                <p>Having ignited my motivation & taste for it over the past year, I began writing "Why We Evolve" which is a series of thriller poems.</p>
                <p>Poems are my favorite medium as word play & choice have a fundamental role in the verses. I chose thriller even though I hardly read thrillers because I've simply never seen a thriller poem & wanted to explore the realm!</p>
                <p>Like many other pieces, this will almost always be a work in progress, such is life!</p>

                <p>As well as being a mentor during the season, I was also the event photographer.</p>
                <p>Beyond capturing different perspectives & quirks of Crimson Robotics, I met other FTC teams we were hosting, many of which are passionate in STEM.</p>
                <p>It wasn't too bad that I got a VIP pass to the match area too! All the parents were jealous, of course.</p>
