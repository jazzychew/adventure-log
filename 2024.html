                <p>Being the youngest in my family for so long, I was incredibly excited to see a new baby in the family!</p>
                <p>She was small but adorable and strong nonetheless; as a gift from her older cousin, I decided to put my crochet skills to use and make a dog for her.</p>
                <p>It definitely took longer than expected with school, robotics, knitting club, and college planning, but I still love how it turned out.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, she liked it too! I think. It's hard to tell with babies.</p>

                    June 2023 - May 2024: created CAD webseries & supervised robot document as CAD lead

                </fig>
                <p>When I first did my CAD education as a freshman, I couldn't help but feel like it was quite laborious.</p>
                <p>Then, actually building and competing further showed me that the CAD education process was slowing down the team, so I started to conceptualize something new.</p>
                <p>By having a real team member make the curriculum for fellow members, I knew it would be more concise and fun to learn. After scripting, filming, and editing all the videos with cute music, the series was complete.</p>
                <p>It was nerve-wracking to have people actually use it, but it was easy to see that the change in learning had a positive effect. Freshmen were actually liking to CAD, and they were well-practiced in Onshape and asking questions.</p>
                <p>Another part of being CAD lead I loved was getting to participate in the design and build of every part of the robot! It was like a weird robotics dream come true.</p>

                <p>Interestingly enough, I had actually joined robotics as a programmer! (before I realized building was much cooler)</p>
                <p>While I didn't end up continuing with java, I became more interested in web design because of a high school class. When I saw the disarray of our team website, I immeadiately set my sights on being webmaster.</p>
                <p>Granted, it wasn't horrible, but the website was outdated and was stuck in 2020.</p>
                <p>Squarespace was easy enough to learn even if it was frustrating at times; soon enough, I had removed the dead links, redesigned the style guide (from the 2010s), and replaced old pictures with new.</p>

                    June 2024: graduating!
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>One year at home, only two last days of school, and I was already graduating.</p>
                <p>I like to think I didn't miss anything in high school. I completely took control of my social life, became a part of a team, started my own club, explored college classes, and more than that, I came out a different person.</p>
                <p>Still, I didn't expect to cry so much. Knowing that part of my life where I was surrounded by my kindergarten friends, complained about the schedule the school gave, getting dropped off by my parents was strange.</p>
                <p>University was something I was striving for, for years. It seemed to creep into whatever I did. Then, why was I so sad to leave high school? Well, maybe it wasn't sadness. Just, overwhelming fullness.</p>
                <p>Knowing I made beautiful friendships and memories was surreal because for nearly a decade prior, I was just the kid with my Papa Smurf stuffy sitting at the elementary school wall, waiting for my dad to pick me up. Now, I was someone who did something. Made friendships, made connections with people who even if we didn't talk again, I would always remember.</p>

                    October 2023 - August 2024: worked as student worker at the MPCA
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Months after my interview at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, I was sure they had picked someone else. Getting a call back just after school started had got me jumping with joy.</p>
                <p>I've always known I wanted to work with the environment, and the MPCA is one of the largest environmental agencies I could possibly work at. Getting the opportunity to work in the grants services unit was amazing since I could directly see the funding that supports the agency's projects, and I could meet a variety of people in MPCA.</p>
                <p>Right when I started, I dove into every project I could. I sharpened my Microsoft skills by creating an Excel sheet full of grant opportunities (which I regularly updated), helping with editing grant forms, and even making a presentation to introduce all of our unit members.</p>
                <p>More than the work though, I wouldn't have stayed so long if it weren't for the amazing team I was with. As a newcomer in the professional world, I was nervous, but I always felt supported with the GSU. I couldn't be more grateful for them!</p>
