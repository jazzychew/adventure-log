                </fig>
                <p>During the pandemic, AAPI hate crimes noticeably increased. Especially as a Chinese-American, I felt a deep connection to my past experiences & the experiences of my community.</p>
                <p>Seeing the opportunity to gather with like-minded people to raise awareness, I eagerly went to the rally with my dad and got to have conversations with allies.</p>
                <p>Many of the allies were people I knew, but never talked to until then.</p>
                <p>Continuing today, I raise awareness about topics that may be difficult to face because as a human race, we deserve to coexist with one another.</p>

                <p>When I was a freshman, I was a member of GirlUp which advocates for gender equality in our school & community!</p>
                <p>Near the end of the year, our president announced that we would be making stickers to help fundraise for our club.</p>
                <p>To help, I created & submitted a design for the stickers, so I was honored when the design was chosen to be printed.</p>

                    September 2021: began my student group Knitting for Humanity
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>During my freshman year (2020 - 2021), I was trying many clubs. However, when I picked up knitting, I realized there was no club for learning how to knit. With the pandemic as well, I wanted to raise awareness for issues that were also plaguing us.</p>
                <p>Because I was the sole leader at the time, I was also the main teacher. Along the way, crocheting was introduced, so I learned to be flexible & open to learning how to crochet myself.</p>
                <p>Apart from the pragmatic skills I acquired like leadership & teaching, I found myself with a community. Being my first time creating a club, the beginnings were turbulent which makes me more grateful for the members who've been there with me!</p>

                    September 2021: started my first in-person year of Robotics
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Rejoining from my freshman year, I went into the 2021-2022 school year ready to commit. On the surface level, Robotics is an amazing opportunity to expand my interest in engineering. More importatntly, it's a great chance to learn more about the collaborative work present in any career.</p>
                <p>I knew I had a passion for engineering, but I was not expecting to enjoy all the different aspects of the club. Even though I started learning the basics during my freshman year, being in-person really enriched my learnings for CAD, prototyping, & construction.</p>
                <p>Part of our values as a FIRST Robotics team, reaching out to our community & engaging kids in STEM is extremely important. To this day, I love our events & seeing kids of different backgrounds excited to learn. Spreading STEM tells kids, BIPOC, girls, whoever, that the world is their oyster!</p>
                <p>Already as a sophomore, Robotics had a massive impact on me. Being part of the team has taught me unspeakable amounts of community, resilience, & of course CADing.</p>
