                    October 2022 - January 2023: Monitor CAD
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>When I learned how to CAD my first year of robotics, I instantly became hooked. While tenacious & fickle, the process of CADing has been an exciting learning experience!</p>
                <p>Near the beginning of the Power Play FTC Season, I decided to start my own passion project for CADing.</p>
                <p>Complex, yet somewhat simple enough, the monitor proved intellecutally intricate with its curved screen.</p>
                <p>Like any other CAD project, when I completed, I felt satisfied with my effort & results, then subsequently forget the frustrations I endured with the system.</p>

                    January 2023: created this webpage!
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>I would link it, but..</p>
                <p>For a long time, I had an interest in code. However, I never got into javascript/java. (sorry, still don't know the difference!)</p>
                <p>Fun fact, even though I'm now in the Mechanical Department in Robotics, I originally joined as a programmer.</p>
                <p>It was when I took my PLTW Computer Science class my sophomore year that I learned more about HTML, CSS, and overall making websites.</p>
                <p>Since then, I wanted to do more with what I learned, and I needed to update my extracurricular portfolio, so I decided to create this website!</p>
                <p>It's been a long journey, figuring out VS Code and relearning/unlearning, but I'm happy with the result. I hope to make more websites in the future!</p>

                </fig>
                <p>Coming into robotics & learning about our social media presence, I wanted to participate in it, but it seemed like more of a pipe dream than reality.</p>
                <p>That was until I got to photograph our FTC competition we hosted, and until I was asked to be media for our Iowa Regionals!</p>
                <p>I had so much fun being able to edit a video for our team since I got to provide a more direct perspective to our team/competition trips, especially being on the ground in Mechanical. It was a pleasure to bridge that gap between grounded experiences in the team and what the world sees!</p>

                    September 2022 - June 2023: crocheted and stitched together patchwork cardigan for my senior pictures
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Because of my knitting club, I was meeting many more crocheters than I had ever before. Since the technique is deemed "easier" than knitting by many, people came to my knitting club with the hopes of learning how to crochet.</p>
                <p>Thus, the smart thing to do was to learn how to crochet of course.</p>
                <p>For my first crochet project then, I had this dream of having a patchwork cardigan since at the time, it was quite popular. It seemed easy enough since all I had to do was make a bunch of squares.</p>
                <p>Although I had prior experience with knitting, learning how to crochet was a fun experience, and I left the project eager to improve for future projects!</p>
