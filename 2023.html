                    October 2022 - January 2023: Monitor CAD
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>When I learned how to CAD my first year of robotics, I instantly became hooked. While tenacious & fickle, the process of CADing has been an exciting learning experience!</p>
                <p>Near the beginning of the Power Play FTC Season, I decided to start my own passion project for CADing.</p>
                <p>Complex, yet somewhat simple enough, the monitor proved intellecutally intricate with its curved screen.</p>
                <p>Like any other CAD project, when I completed, I felt satisfied with my effort & results, then subsequently forget the frustrations I endured with the system.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore <a href= "https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2fb5cc92a403cc171d5d122a/w/bde2799849029b403d400bcc/e/3dc44a48ab91cd595a58d436" class="link">my document! </a></p>

                    January 2023: created this webpage!

                <p>I would link it, but..</p>
                <p>For a long time, I had an interest in code. However, I never got into javascript/java. (sorry, still don't know the difference!)</p>
                <p>Fun fact, even though I'm now in the Mechanical Department in Robotics, I originally joined as a programmer.</p>
                <p>It was when I took my PLTW Computer Science class my sophomore year that I learned more about HTML, CSS, and overall making websites.</p>
                <p>Since then, I wanted to do more with what I learned, and I needed to update my extracurricular portfolio, so I decided to create this website!</p>
                <p>It's been a long journey, figuring out VS Code and relearning/unlearning, but I'm happy with the result. I hope to make more websites in the future!</p>
