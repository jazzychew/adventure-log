                    October 2022 - January 2023: Monitor CAD
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>When I learned how to CAD my first year of robotics, I instantly became hooked. While tenacious & fickle, the process of CADing has been an exciting learning experience!</p>
                <p>Near the beginning of the Power Play FTC Season, I decided to start my own passion project for CADing.</p>
                <p>Complex, yet somewhat simple enough, the monitor proved intellecutally intricate with its curved screen.</p>
                <p>Like any other CAD project, when I completed, I felt satisfied with my effort & results, then subsequently forget the frustrations I endured with the system.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore <a href= "https://cad.onshape.com/documents/2fb5cc92a403cc171d5d122a/w/bde2799849029b403d400bcc/e/3dc44a48ab91cd595a58d436" class="link">my document! </a></p>

                <p>I would link it, but..</p>
                <p>For a long time, I had an interest in code. However, I never got into javascript/java. (sorry, still don't know the difference!)</p>
                <p>Fun fact, even though I'm now in the Mechanical Department in Robotics, I originally joined as a programmer.</p>
                <p>It was when I took my PLTW Computer Science class my sophomore year that I learned more about HTML, CSS, and overall making websites.</p>
                <p>Since then, I wanted to do more with what I learned, and I needed to update my extracurricular portfolio, so I decided to create this website!</p>
                <p>It's been a long journey, figuring out VS Code and relearning/unlearning, but I'm happy with the result. I hope to make more websites in the future!</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Coming into robotics & learning about our social media presence, I wanted to participate in it, but it seemed like more of a pipe dream than reality.</p>
                <p>That was until I got to photograph our FTC competition we hosted, and until I was asked to be media for our Iowa Regionals!</p>
                <p>I had so much fun being able to edit a video for our team since I got to provide a more direct perspective to our team/competition trips, especially being on the ground in Mechanical. It was a pleasure to bridge that gap between grounded experiences in the team and what the world sees!</p>

                    September 2022 - June 2023: crocheted and stitched together patchwork cardigan for my senior pictures
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Because of my knitting club, I was meeting many more crocheters than I had ever before. Since the technique is deemed "easier" than knitting by many, people came to my knitting club with the hopes of learning how to crochet.</p>
                <p>Thus, the smart thing to do was to learn how to crochet of course.</p>
                <p>For my first crochet project then, I had this dream of having a patchwork cardigan since at the time, it was quite popular. It seemed easy enough since all I had to do was make a bunch of squares.</p>
                <p>Although I had prior experience with knitting, learning how to crochet was a fun experience, and I left the project eager to improve for future projects!</p>

                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Since I enjoyed my experience at Three Rivers last summer, I was hoping to work there again.</p>
                <p>While working with customers could be stressful at times, I liked being in an environment where I could interact with coworkers my age.</p>
                <p>More than that, being able to provide other people a fun experience on the water was fulfilling, whether it was an experience with family or friends.</p>
                <p>It was exciting building connection not only with customers from my community, but also with new coworkers!</p>

                </fig>
                <p>Despite the worrying feat of the 5K involved with this triathlon, I decided to challenge myself and register for it.</p>
                <p>It had been a while since I had properly practiced running due to my physical therapy during 2020 and 2021, but I was excited to restart it.</p>
                <p>Especially with the daunting swim section, I wasted no time in training for this triathlon.</p>
                <p>It was liberating to push myself to the limit for this triathlon, and I had a lot of fun since I was racing within my community!</p>

                </fig>
                <p>Beginning my journey at Mathnasium, I felt excited to tutor since in the past, I had been a peer tutor in my school. Also, because of robotics, I had interacted with Mathnasium before.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed learning about how Mathnasium operates and the unique methods used in teaching kids math.</p>
                <p>Growing familiar with the kids was rewarding since we had a mutual enjoyment for the tutoring experience. I'd like to think I was the cool tutor.</p>
                <p>Despite ending my tutoring employment at Mathnasium, I still hold the interactions I had with the kids dear to me, and it inspires me to become both a better leader and learner. I found that those two roles are closely connected.</p>

                    December 2023: hosted and emceed for high school FTC competition
                    </figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>Since Crimson Robotics hosts the local FTC competition for our area, I was used to volunteering for the event every Winter. Although, when my friend approached me about being an emcee for the matches with him, I was definitely surprised.</p>
                <p>I wasn't resistant because of my surprise though, and I easily agreed since I loved the idea of being able to have fun with my friend and giving that energy to the event.</p>
                <p>I thought it was a fun experience getting to know the inner works of the matches; for example, how they score or determine winners. More than that though, I had a great time analyzing all the different robots on such a close proximity.</p>
                <p>Going from competing in FTC to being photographer to emcee, I'm really grateful to have the opportunity to see our event in so many perspectives. Because not only did I see the event differently, I got to see all of the effort every party puts in for our FTC competitions.</p>
