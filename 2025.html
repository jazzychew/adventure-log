                <p>Right at the end of fall semester, I was simply checking my emails when I saw there was an open research opportunity. I read the lab is in nuclear physics, but I decided to shoot my shot anyway.</p>
                <p>I guess checking my email paid off since later during break, I had interviewed to join the group, and I scheduled my first on-campus meeting!</p>
                <p>To explain my role, I would be in charge of creating a process to ensure the quality of light guides (mirrors). During the winter, I worked with a senior who had worked on the light guides before to learn the polishing process to create the mirrors as well as available resources we could use for the QA process.</p>
                <p>It was a bit nerve-wracking to be a part of a lab since I had never experienced it before, but I'm glad I had Shreyas help me, and I hope to progress further as I grow more accustomed to the lab.</p>
